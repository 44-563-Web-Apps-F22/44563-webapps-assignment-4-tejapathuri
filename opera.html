    <h5>HANNAH</h5>
    <p>Nay, gentle maidens, you sing well but vainly, for
        Rose is still heart-free, and looks but coldly upon her many
        suitors.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>ZORAH</h5>
    <p>It's very disappointing. Every young man in the
        village is in love with her, but they are appalled by her beauty
        and modesty, and won't declare themselves; so, until she makes
        her own choice, there's no chance for anybody else.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>RUTH</h5>
    <p>This is, perhaps, the only village in the world that
        possesses an endowed corps of professional bridesmaids who are
        bound to be on duty every day from ten to four—and it is at
        least six months since our services were required. The pious
        charity by which we exist is practically wasted!
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>ZOR</h5>

    <p>We shall be disendowed—that will be the end of it!
        Dame Hannah—you're a nice old person—you could marry if you
        liked. There's old Adam—Robin's faithful servant—he loves you
        with all the frenzy of a boy of fourteen.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>HAN</h5>
    <p>Nay—that may never be, for I am pledged!</p>
    <h5>ALL</h5>
    <p>To whom?</p>
    <br>
    <h5>HAN</h5>
    <p> To an eternal maidenhood! Many years ago I was
        betrothed to a god-like youth who woo'd me under an assumed name.
        But on the very day upon which our wedding was to have been
        celebrated, I discovered that he was no other than Sir Roderic
        Murgatroyd, one of the bad Baronets of Ruddigore, and the uncle
        of the man who now bears that title. As a son of that accursed
        race he was no husband for an honest girl, so, madly as I loved
        him, I left him then and there. He died but ten years since, but
        I never saw him again.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>ZOR</h5>
    <p>But why should you not marry a bad Baronet of
        Ruddigore?
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>RUTH</h5>
    <p>All baronets are bad; but was he worse than other
        baronets?
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5>HAN</h5>
    <p>My child, he was accursed.</p>
    <br>
    <h5>ZOR</h5>
    <p>But who cursed him? Not you, I trust!</p>
    <h5>HAN</h5>
    <p>The curse is on all his line and has been, ever since
        the time of Sir Rupert, the first Baronet. Listen, and you shall
        hear the legend:
    </p>
